# Intel Image Classification Project

## Project Overview
This project involves classifying natural scenes into six categories: buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea, and street. The dataset used is the Intel Image Classification Dataset, available on Kaggle.

The project is divided into two phases:
1. **Phase 1**: Implement a basic CNN model to classify the images.
2. **Phase 2**: Enhance the model by integrating an LSTM layer, forming a CNN + LSTM hybrid model, and compare its performance against the CNN model.
